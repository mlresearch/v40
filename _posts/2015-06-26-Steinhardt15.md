title: Minimax rates for memory-bounded sparse linear regression
abstract: 'We establish a minimax lower bound of Ω(\frackdBε) on the sample size needed
  to estimate parameters in a k-sparse linear regression of dimension d under memory
  restrictions to B bits, where εis the \ell_2 parameter error.  When the covariance
  of the regressors is the identity matrix, we also provide an algorithm that uses
  \tildeO(B+k) bits and requires \tildeO(\frackdBε^2) observations to achieve error
  ε. Our lower bound also holds in the more general communication-bounded setting,
  where instead of a memory bound, at most B bits of information are allowed to be
  (adaptively) communicated about each sample. '

title: On Consistent Surrogate Risk Minimization and Property Elicitation
abstract: Surrogate risk minimization is a popular framework for supervised learning;
  property elicitation is a widely studied area in probability forecasting, machine
  learning, statistics and economics. In this paper, we connect these two themes by
  showing that calibrated surrogate losses in supervised learning can essentially
  be viewed as eliciting or estimating certain properties of the underlying conditional
  label distribution that are sufficient to construct an optimal classifier under
  the target loss of interest. Our study helps to shed light on the design of convex
  calibrated surrogates. We also give a new framework for designing convex calibrated
  surrogates under low-noise conditions by eliciting properties that allow one to
  construct ‘coarse’ estimates of the underlying distribution.

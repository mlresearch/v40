title: Learning and inference in the presence of corrupted inputs
abstract: We consider a model where given an uncorrupted input an adversary can corrupt
  it to one out of m corrupted inputs. We model the classification and inference problems
  as a zero-sum game between a learner, minimizing the expected error, and an adversary,
  maximizing the expected error. The value of this game is the optimal error rate
  achievable. For learning using a limited hypothesis class \mathcalH over corrupted
  inputs, we give an efficient algorithm that given an uncorrupted sample returns
  a hypothesis hâˆˆ\mathcalH whose error on adversarially corrupted inputs is near optimal.
  Our algorithm uses as a blackbox an oracle that solves the ERM problem for the hypothesis
  class \mathcalH. We provide a generalization bound for our setting, showing that
  for a sufficiently large sample, the performance on the sample and future unseen
  corrupted inputs will be similar. This gives an efficient learning algorithm for
  our adversarial setting, based on an ERM oracle. We also consider an inference related
  setting of the problem, where given a corrupted input, the learner queries the  target
  function on various uncorrupted inputs and generates a prediction regarding the
  given corrupted input. There is no limitation on the prediction function the learner
  may generate, so implicitly the hypothesis class includes all possible hypotheses.
  In this setting we characterize the optimal learner policy as a minimum vertex cover
  in a given bipartite graph, and the optimal adversary policy as a maximum matching
  in the same bipartite graph. We design efficient local algorithms for approximating
  minimum vertex cover in bipartite graphs, which implies an efficient near optimal
  algorithm for the learner.

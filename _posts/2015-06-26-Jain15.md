title: Fast Exact Matrix Completion with Finite Samples
abstract: 'Matrix completion is the problem of recovering a low rank matrix by observing
  a small fraction of its entries. A series of recent works (Keshavan 2012),(Jain
  et al. 2013) and (Hardt, 2013) have proposed fast non-convex optimization based
  iterative algorithms to solve this problem. However, the sample complexity in all
  these results is sub-optimal in its dependence on the rank, condition number and
  the desired accuracy. In this paper, we present a fast iterative algorithm that
  solves the matrix completion problem by observing O\left(nr^5 \log^3 n\right) entries,
  which is independent of the condition number and the desired accuracy. The run time
  of our algorithm is O\left( nr^7\log^3 n\log 1/ε\right) which is near linear in
  the dimension of the matrix. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first near
  linear time algorithm for exact matrix completion with finite sample complexity
  (i.e. independent of ε). Our algorithm is based on a well known projected gradient
  descent method, where the projection is onto the (non-convex) set of low rank matrices.
  There are two key ideas in our result: 1) our argument is based on a \ell_∞norm
  potential function (as opposed to the spectral norm) and provides a novel way to
  obtain perturbation bounds for it. 2) we prove and use a natural extension of the
  Davis-Kahan theorem to obtain perturbation bounds on the best low rank approximation
  of matrices with good eigen gap. Both of these ideas may be of independent interest. '

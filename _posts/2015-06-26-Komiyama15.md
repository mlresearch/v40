title: Regret Lower Bound and Optimal Algorithm in Dueling Bandit Problem
abstract: We study the K-armed dueling bandit problem, a variation of the standard
  stochastic bandit problem where the feedback is limited to relative comparisons
  of a pair of arms. We introduce a tight asymptotic regret lower bound that is based
  on the information divergence. An algorithm that is inspired by the Deterministic
  Minimum Empirical Divergence algorithm (Honda and Takemura, 2010) is proposed, and
  its regret is analyzed. The proposed algorithm is found to be the first one with
  a regret upper bound that matches the lower bound. Experimental comparisons of dueling
  bandit algorithms show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms existing
  ones.

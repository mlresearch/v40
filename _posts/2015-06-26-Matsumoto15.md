title: Online Density Estimation of Bradley-Terry Models
abstract: We consider an online density estimation problem for the Bradley-Terry model,
  where each model parameter defines the probability of a match result between any
  pair in a set of n teams. The problem is hard because the loss function (i.e., the
  negative log-likelihood function in our problem setting) is not convex. To avoid
  the non-convexity, we can change parameters so that the loss function becomes convex
  with respect to the new parameter. But then the radius K of the reparameterized
  domain may be infinite, where K depends on the outcome sequence. So we put a mild
  assumption that guarantees that K is finite. We can thus employ standard online
  convex optimization algorithms, namely OGD and ONS, over the reparameterized domain,
  and get regret bounds O(n^\frac12(\ln K)\sqrtT) and O(n^\frac32K\ln T), respectively,
  where T is the horizon of the game. The bounds roughly means that OGD is better
  when K is large while ONS is better when K is small. But how large can K be? We
  show that K can be as large as Î˜(T^n-1), which implies that the worst case regret
  bounds of OGD and ONS are O(n^\frac32\sqrtT\ln T) and \tildeO(n^\frac32(T)^n-1),
  respectively. We then propose a version of Follow the Regularized Leader, whose
  regret bound is close to the minimum of those of OGD and ONS. In other words, our
  algorithm is competitive with both for a wide range of values of K. In particular,
  our algorithm achieves the worst case regret bound O(n^\frac52T^\frac13 \ln T),
  which is slightly better than OGD with respect to T. In addition, our algorithm
  works without the knowledge K, which is a practical advantage.

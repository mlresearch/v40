title: Improved Sum-of-Squares Lower Bounds for Hidden Clique and Hidden Submatrix
  Problems
abstract: 'Given a large data matrix A∈\mathbbR^n\times n, we consider the problem
  of determining whether its entries are i.i.d. from some known marginal distribution
  A_ij∼P_0, or instead A contains a principal submatrix A_\sf Q,\sf Q whose entries
  have marginal distribution A_ij∼P_1≠P_0. As a special case, the hidden (or planted)
  clique problem is finding a planted clique in an otherwise uniformly random graph.
  Assuming unbounded computational resources, this hypothesis testing problem is statistically
  solvable  provided |\sf Q|\ge C \log n for a suitable constant C. However, despite
  substantial effort, no polynomial time algorithm is known that succeeds with high
  probability when |\sf Q| = o(\sqrtn).  Recently, \citemeka2013association proposed
  a method to establish lower bounds for the hidden clique problem within the Sum
  of Squares (SOS) semidefinite hierarchy. Here we consider the degree-4 SOS relaxation,
  and study the construction of \citemeka2013association to prove that SOS fails unless
  k\ge C\,n^1/3/\log n. An argument presented by \citeBarakLectureNotes implies that
  this lower bound cannot be substantially  improved unless  the witness construction
  is changed in the proof. Our proof uses the moment method to bound the spectrum
  of a certain random association scheme, i.e. a symmetric random matrix whose rows
  and columns are indexed by the edges of an Erdös-Renyi random graph. '

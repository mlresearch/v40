title: 'Regularized Linear Regression: A Precise Analysis of the Estimation Error'
abstract: Non-smooth regularized convex optimization procedures have emerged as a
  powerful tool to recover structured signals (sparse, low-rank, etc.) from (possibly
  compressed) noisy linear measurements. We focus on the problem of linear regression
  and consider a general class of optimization methods that minimize a loss function
  measuring the misfit of the model to the observations with an added structured-inducing
  regularization term. Celebrated instances include the LASSO, Group-LASSO, Least-Absolute
  Deviations method, etc.. We develop a quite general framework for how to determine
  precise prediction performance guaranties (e.g. mean-square-error) of such methods
  for the case of Gaussian measurement ensemble. The  machinery builds upon  Gordonâ€™s
  Gaussian min-max theorem under additional convexity assumptions that arise in many
  practical applications. This theorem associates with a primary optimization (PO)
  problem a simplified auxiliary optimization  (AO) problem from which we can tightly
  infer properties of the original (PO), such as the optimal cost, the norm of the
  optimal solution, etc. Our theory applies to general loss functions and regularization
  and provides guidelines on how to optimally tune the regularizer coefficient when
  certain structural properties (such as sparsity level, rank, etc.) are known.

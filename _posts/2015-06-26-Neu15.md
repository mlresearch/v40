title: First-order regret bounds for combinatorial semi-bandits
abstract: We consider the problem of online combinatorial optimization under semi-bandit
  feedback, where a learner has to repeatedly pick actions from a combinatorial decision
  set in order to minimize the total losses associated with its decisions. After making
  each decision, the learner observes the losses associated with its action, but not
  other losses. For this problem, there are several learning algorithms that guarantee
  that the learnerâ€™s expected regret grows as \widetildeO(\sqrtT) with the number
  of rounds T. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that improves this scaling to
  \widetildeO(\sqrtL_T^*), where L_T^* is the total loss of the best action. Our algorithm
  is among the first to achieve such guarantees in a partial-feedback scheme, and
  the first one to do so in a combinatorial setting.

title: MCMC Learning
abstract: 'The theory of learning under the uniform distribution is rich and deep,
  with connections to cryptography, computational complexity, and the analysis of
  boolean functions to name a few areas. This theory however is very limited due to
  the fact that the uniform distribution and the corresponding Fourier basis are rarely
  encountered as a statistical model. A family of distributions that vastly generalizes
  the uniform distribution on the Boolean cube is that of distributions represented
  by Markov Random Fields (MRF). Markov Random Fields are one of the main tools for
  modeling high dimensional data in many areas of statistics and machine learning.
  In this paper we initiate the investigation of extending central ideas, methods
  and algorithms from the theory of learning under the uniform distribution to the
  setup of learning concepts given examples from MRF distributions. In particular,
  our results establish a novel connection between properties of MCMC sampling of
  MRFs and learning under the MRF distribution. '

title: Online {PCA} with Spectral Bounds
abstract: 'This paper revisits the online PCA problem. Given a stream of n vectors
  x_t ∈\mathbbR^d (columns of X) the algorithm must output y_t ∈\mathbbR^\ell  (columns
  of Y) before receiving x_t+1. The goal of online PCA is to simultaneously minimize
  the target dimension \ell and the error \|X - (XY^\scriptstyle  \textrm +)Y\|^2.
  We describe two simple and deterministic algorithms. The first, receives a parameter
  ∆and guarantees that \|X - (XY^\scriptstyle  \textrm +)Y\|^2 is not significantly
  larger than ∆. It requires a target dimension of \ell = O(k/ε) for any k,εsuch that
  ∆\ge ε\sigma_1^2 + \sigma_k+1^2, with \sigma_i being the i’th singular value of
  X. The second receives k and εand guarantees that \|X - (XY^\scriptstyle  \textrm
  +)Y\|^2 \le ε\sigma_1^2 + \sigma_k+1^2. It requires a target dimension of O( k\log
  n/ε^2). Different models and algorithms for Online PCA were considered in the past.
  This is the first that achieves a bound on the spectral norm of the residual matrix. '

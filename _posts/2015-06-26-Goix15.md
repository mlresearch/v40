title: 'Learning the dependence structure of rare events: a non-asymptotic study'
abstract: 'Assessing the probability of occurrence of extreme events  is a crucial
  issue in various fields like finance, insurance, telecommunication or environmental
  sciences. In a multivariate framework, the tail dependence is characterized by the
  so-called \emphstable tail dependence function (\textscstdf). Learning this structure
  is the keystone of multivariate extremes. Although extensive studies have proved
  consistency and asymptotic normality for the empirical version of the \textscstdf,
  non-asymptotic bounds are still missing. The main purpose of this paper is to fill
  this gap. Taking advantage of adapted VC-type concentration inequalities, upper
  bounds are derived with expected rate of convergence in O(k^-1/2). The concentration
  tools involved in this analysis rely on a more general study of maximal deviations
  in low probability regions, and thus directly apply to the classification of extreme
  data. '

title: Simple, Efficient, and Neural Algorithms for Sparse Coding
abstract: Sparse coding is a basic task in many fields including signal processing,
  neuroscience and machine learning where the goal is to learn a basis that enables
  a sparse representation of a given set of data, if one exists. Its standard formulation
  is as a non-convex optimization problem which is solved in practice by heuristics
  based on alternating minimization.  Recent work has resulted in several algorithms
  for sparse coding with provable guarantees, but somewhat surprisingly these are
  outperformed by the simple alternating minimization heuristics. Here we give a general
  framework for understanding alternating minimization which we leverage to analyze
  existing heuristics and to design new ones also with provable guarantees. Some of
  these algorithms seem implementable on simple neural architectures, which was the
  original motivation of Olshausen and Field in introducing sparse coding. We also
  give the first efficient algorithm for sparse coding that works almost up to the
  information theoretic limit for sparse recovery on incoherent dictionaries. All
  previous algorithms that approached or surpassed this limit run in time exponential
  in some natural parameter. Finally, our algorithms improve upon the sample complexity
  of existing approaches. We believe that our analysis framework will have applications
  in other settings where simple iterative algorithms are used

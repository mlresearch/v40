title: 'Open Problem: The landscape of the loss surfaces of multilayer networks'
abstract: Deep learning has enjoyed a resurgence of interest in the last few years
  for such applications as image and speech recognition, or natural language processing.
  The vast majority of practical applications of deep learning focus on supervised
  learning, where the supervised loss function is minimized using stochastic gradient
  descent. The properties of this highly non-convex loss function, such as its landscape
  and the behavior of critical points (maxima, minima, and saddle points), as well
  as the reason why large- and small-size networks achieve radically different practical
  performance, are however very poorly understood. It was only recently shown that
  new results in spin-glass theory potentially may provide an explanation for these
  problems by establishing a connection between the loss function of the neural networks
  and the Hamiltonian of the spherical spin-glass models. The connection between both
  models relies on a number of possibly unrealistic assumptions, yet the empirical
  evidence suggests that the connection may exist in real. The question we pose is
  whether it is possible to drop some of these assumptions to establish a stronger
  connection between both models.

title: Algorithms for Lipschitz Learning on Graphs
abstract: 'We develop fast algorithms for solving regression problems on graphs where
  one is given the value of a function at some vertices, and must find its smoothest
  possible extension to all vertices. The extension we compute is the absolutely minimal
  Lipschitz extension, and is the limit for large p of p-Laplacian regularization.
  We present an algorithm that computes a minimal Lipschitz extension in expected
  linear time, and an algorithm that computes an absolutely minimal Lipschitz extension
  in expected time \widetildeO (m n). The latter algorithm has variants that seem
  to run much faster in practice. These extensions are particularly amenable to regularization:
  we can perform l_0-regularization on the given values in polynomial time and l_1-regularization
  on the initial function values and on graph edge weights in time \widetildeO (m^3/2).
  Our definitions and algorithms naturally extend to directed graphs.'

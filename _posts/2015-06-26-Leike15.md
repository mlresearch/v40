title: Bad Universal Priors and Notions of Optimality
abstract: 'A big open question of algorithmic information theory is the choice of
  the universal Turing machine (UTM). For Kolmogorov complexity and Solomonoff induction
  we have invariance theorems: the choice of the UTM changes bounds only by a constant.
  For the universally intelligent agent AIXI (Hutter, 2005) no invariance theorem
  is known. Our results are entirely negative: we discuss cases in which unlucky or
  adversarial choices of the UTM cause AIXI to misbehave drastically. We show that
  Legg-Hutter intelligence and thus balanced Pareto optimality is entirely subjective,
  and that every policy is Pareto optimal in the class of all computable environments.
  This undermines all existing optimality properties for AIXI. While it may still
  serve as a gold standard for AI, our results imply that AIXI is a \emphrelative
  theory, dependent on the choice of the UTM.'

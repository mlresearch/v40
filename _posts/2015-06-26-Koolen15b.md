title: 'Open Problem: Online Sabotaged Shortest Path'
abstract: There has been much work on extending the prediction with expert advice
  methodology to the case when experts are composed of components and there are combinatorially
  many such experts. One of the core examples is the Online Shortest Path problem
  where the components are edges and the experts are paths. In this note we revisit
  this online routing problem in the case where in each trial some of the edges or
  components are sabotaged / blocked. In the vanilla expert setting a known method
  can solve this extension where experts are now awake or asleep in each trial. We
  ask whether this technology can be upgraded efficiently to the case when at each
  trial every component can be awake or asleep. It is easy get to get an initial regret
  bound by using combinatorially many experts. However it is open whether there are
  efficient algorithms achieving the same regret.

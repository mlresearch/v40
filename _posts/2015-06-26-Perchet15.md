title: Batched Bandit Problems
abstract: Motivated by practical applications, chiefly clinical trials, we study the
  regret achievable for stochastic multi-armed bandits under the constraint that the
  employed policy must split trials into a small number of batches. Our results show
  that a very small number of batches gives already close to minimax optimal regret
  bounds and we also evaluate the number of trials in each batch. As a byproduct,
  we derive optimal policies with low switching cost for stochastic bandits.

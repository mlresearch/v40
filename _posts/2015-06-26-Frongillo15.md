title: Vector-Valued Property Elicitation
abstract: The elicitation of a statistic, or property of a distribution, is the task
  of devising proper scoring rules, equivalently proper losses, which incentivize
  an agent or algorithm to truthfully estimate the desired property of the underlying
  probability distribution or data set.  Leveraging connections between elicitation
  and convex analysis, we address the vector-valued property case, which has received
  little attention in the literature despite its applications to both machine learning
  and statistics. We first provide a very general characterization of linear and ratio-of-linear
  properties, the first of which resolves an open problem by unifying and strengthening
  several previous characterizations in machine learning and statistics.  We then
  ask which vectors of properties admit nonseparable scores, which cannot be expressed
  as a sum of scores for each coordinate separately, a natural desideratum for machine
  learning.  We show that linear and ratio-of-linear do admit nonseparable scores,
  and provide evidence for a conjecture that these are the only such properties (up
  to link functions). Finally, we give a general method for producing identification
  functions and address an open problem by showing that convex maximal level sets
  are insufficient for elicitability in general.

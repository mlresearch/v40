title: 'Partitioning Well-Clustered Graphs: Spectral Clustering Works!'
abstract: In this work we study the widely used \emphspectral clustering algorithms,
  i.e. partition a graph into k clusters via (1) embedding the vertices of a graph
  into a low-dimensional space using the bottom eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrix,
  and (2) partitioning embedded points via k-means algorithms.  We show that, for
  a wide class of \emphwell-clustered graphs, spectral clustering algorithms can give
  a good approximation of the optimal clustering. To the best of our knowledge, it
  is the \emphfirst theoretical analysis of spectral clustering algorithms for a wide
  family of graphs, even though such approach was proposed in the early 1990s and
  has comprehensive applications. We also give a nearly-linear time algorithm for
  partitioning well-clustered graphs, which is based on heat kernel embeddings and
  approximate nearest neighbor data structures.

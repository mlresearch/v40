title: 'Stochastic Block Model and Community Detection in Sparse Graphs: A spectral
  algorithm with optimal rate of recovery'
abstract: In this paper, we present  and analyze  a simple  and robust  spectral algorithm
  for the stochastic block model with k blocks, for any k fixed.  Our algorithm works
  with graphs having constant edge density, under an optimal condition on the gap
  between the density inside a block and the density between the blocks. As a co-product,
  we settle an open question posed by Abbe et. al. concerning  censor block models.

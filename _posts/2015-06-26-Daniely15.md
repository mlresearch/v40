title: A PTAS for Agnostically Learning Halfspaces
abstract: We present a PTAS for agnostically learning halfspaces w.r.t. the uniform
  distribution on the d dimensional sphere. Namely, we show that for every μ>0 there
  is an algorithm that runs in time \mathrmpoly\left(d,\frac1ε\right), and is guaranteed
  to return a classifier with error at most (1+μ)\mathrmopt+ε, where \mathrmopt is
  the error of the best halfspace classifier. This improves on Awasthi, Balcan and
  Long (STOC 2014) who showed an algorithm with an (unspecified) constant approximation
  ratio. Our algorithm combines the classical technique of polynomial regression,
  together with the new localization technique of Awasthi et. al.

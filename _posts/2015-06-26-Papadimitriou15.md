title: Cortical Learning via Prediction
abstract: What is the mechanism of learning in the brain?  Despite breathtaking advances
  in neuroscience,  and in machine learning, we do not seem close to an answer.  Using
  Valiant’s neuronal model as a foundation, we introduce PJOIN (for “predictive join"),
  a primitive that combines association and prediction. We show that PJOIN can be
  implemented naturally in Valiant’s conservative, formal model of cortical computation.
  Using PJOIN — and almost nothing else — we give a simple algorithm for unsupervised
  learning of arbitrary ensembles of binary patterns (solving an open problem in Valiant’s
  work). This algorithm relies crucially on prediction, and entails significant downward
  traffic (“feedback") while parsing stimuli. Prediction and feedback are well-known
  features of neural cognition and, as far as we know, this is the first theoretical
  prediction of their essential role in learning.

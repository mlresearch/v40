title: Optimally Combining Classifiers Using Unlabeled Data
abstract: We develop a worst-case analysis of aggregation of classifier ensembles
  for binary classification. The task of predicting to minimize error is formulated
  as a game played over a given set of unlabeled data (a transductive setting), where
  prior label information is encoded as constraints on the game. The minimax solution
  of this game identifies cases where a weighted combination of the classifiers can
  perform significantly better than any single classifier.

title: 'Max vs Min: Tensor Decomposition and ICA with nearly Linear Sample Complexity'
abstract: We present a simple, general technique for reducing the sample complexity
  of matrix and tensor decomposition algorithms applied to distributions. We use the
  technique to give a polynomial-time algorithm for standard ICA with sample complexity
  nearly linear in the dimension, thereby improving substantially on previous bounds.
  The analysis is based on properties of random polynomials, namely the spacings of
  an ensemble of polynomials. Our technique also applies to other applications of
  tensor decompositions, including spherical Gaussian mixture models.

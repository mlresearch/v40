title: Learning Overcomplete Latent Variable Models through Tensor Methods
abstract: 'We provide guarantees for learning latent variable models  emphasizing
  on the overcomplete regime, where the dimensionality of the latent space exceeds  the
  observed dimensionality.  In particular, we consider multiview mixtures, ICA, and
  sparse coding models. Our main tool is a new algorithm for tensor decomposition
  that works in the overcomplete regime. In the semi-supervised setting, we exploit
  label information to get a rough estimate of the model parameters, and then refine
  it using the tensor method on unlabeled samples. We establish learning guarantees   when
  the number of components scales as k=o(d^p/2), where d is the observed dimension,
  and p is the order of the observed moment employed in the tensor method (usually
  p=3,4).  In the unsupervised setting, a simple initialization algorithm based on
  SVD of the tensor slices is proposed, and the guarantees are provided under the
  stricter condition that k ≤βd (where constant βcan be larger than 1). For the learning
  applications, we provide tight sample complexity bounds through novel covering arguments. '

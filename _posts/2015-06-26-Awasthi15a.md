title: Label optimal regret bounds for online local learning
abstract: We resolve an open question from Christiano (2014b) posed in COLTâ€™14 regarding
  the optimal dependency of the regret achievable for online local learning on the
  size of the label set. In this framework, the algorithm is shown a pair of items
  at each step, chosen from a set of n items. The learner then predicts a label for
  each item, from a label set of size L and receives a real valued payoff. This is
  a natural framework which captures many interesting scenarios such as online gambling
  and online max cut. Christiano (2014a) designed an efficient online learning algorithm
  for this problem achieving a regret of O(\sqrtnL^3 T), where T is the number of
  rounds. Information theoretically, one can achieve a regret of O(\sqrtn \log L T).
  One of the main open questions left in this framework concerns closing the above
  gap. In this work, we provide a complete answer to the question above via two main
  results. We show, via a tighter analysis, that the semi-definite programming based
  algorithm of Christiano (2014a) in fact achieves a regret of O(\sqrtnLT). Second,
  we show a matching computational lower bound. Namely, we show that a polynomial
  time algorithm for online local learning with lower regret would imply a polynomial
  time algorithm for the planted clique problem which is widely believed to be hard.
  We prove a similar hardness result under a related conjecture concerning planted
  dense subgraphs that we put forth. Unlike planted clique, the planted dense subgraph
  problem does not have any known quasi-polynomial time algorithms. Computational
  lower bounds for online learning are relatively rare, and we hope that the ideas
  developed in this work will lead to lower bounds for other online learning scenarios
  as well.

title: 'The entropic barrier: a simple and optimal universal self-concordant barrier'
abstract: We prove that the Fenchel dual of the log-Laplace transform of the uniform
  measure on a convex body in \mathbbR^n is a (1+o(1)) n-self-concordant barrier,
  improving a seminal result of Nesterov and Nemirovski. This gives the first explicit
  construction of a universal barrier for convex bodies with optimal self-concordance
  parameter. The proof is based on basic geometry of log-concave distributions, and
  elementary duality in exponential families. The result also gives a new perspective
  on the minimax regret for the linear bandit problem.

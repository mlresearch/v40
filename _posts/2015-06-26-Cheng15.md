title: Efficient Sampling for Gaussian Graphical Models  via Spectral Sparsification
abstract: 'Motivated by a sampling problem basic to computational statistical inference,
  we develop a toolset based on spectral sparsification for a family of fundamental
  problems involving Gaussian sampling, matrix functionals, and reversible Markov
  chains. Drawing on the connection between Gaussian graphical models and the recent
  breakthroughs in spectral graph theory, we give the first nearly linear time algorithm
  for the following basic matrix problem: Given an n\times n Laplacian matrix \mathbfM
  and a constant -1 ≤p ≤1, provide efficient access to a sparse n\times n linear operator
  \tilde\mathbfC such that $\mathbfM^p ≈\tilde\mathbfC \tilde\mathbfC^⊤, where ≈denotes
  spectral similarity. When p is set to -1, this gives the first parallel sampling
  algorithm that is essentially optimal both in total work and randomness for Gaussian
  random fields with symmetric diagonally dominant (SDD) precision matrices. It only
  requires \em nearly linear work and 2n \em i.i.d. random univariate Gaussian samples
  to generate an n-dimensional \em i.i.d. Gaussian random sample in polylogarithmic
  depth. The key ingredient of our approach is an integration of spectral sparsification
  with multilevel method: Our algorithms are based on factoring \mathbfM^p$ into a
  product of well-conditioned matrices, then introducing powers and replacing dense
  matrices with sparse approximations. We give two sparsification methods for this
  approach that may be of independent interest. The first invokes Maclaurin series
  on the factors, while the second builds on our new nearly linear time spectral sparsification
  algorithm for random-walk matrix polynomials. We expect these algorithmic advances
  will also help to strengthen the connection between machine learning and spectral
  graph theory, two of the most active fields in understanding large data and networks. '

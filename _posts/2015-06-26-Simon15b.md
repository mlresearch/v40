title: 'Open Problem: Recursive Teaching Dimension Versus VC Dimension'
abstract: 'The Recursive Teaching Dimension (RTD) of a concept class \mathcalC is
  a complexity parameter referring to the worst-case number of labelled examples needed
  to learn any target concept in \mathcalC from a teacher following the recursive
  teaching model. It is the first teaching complexity notion for which interesting
  relationships to the VC dimension (VCD) have been established. In particular, for
  finite maximum classes of a given VCD d, the RTD equals d. To date, there is no
  concept class known for which the ratio of RTD over VCD exceeds 3/2. However, the
  only known upper bound on RTD in terms of VCD is exponential in the VCD and depends
  on the size of the concept class. We pose the following question: is the RTD upper-bounded
  by a function that grows only linearly in the VCD? Answering this question would
  further our understanding of the relationships between the complexity of teaching
  and the complexity of learning from randomly chosen examples. In addition, the answer
  to this question, whether positive or negative, is known to have implications on
  the study of the long-standing open sample compression conjecture, which claims
  that every concept class of VCD d has a sample compression scheme in which samples
  for concepts in the class are compressed to subsets of size no larger than d.'

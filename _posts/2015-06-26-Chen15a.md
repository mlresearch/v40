title: 'Learnability of Solutions to Conjunctive Queries: The Full Dichotomy'
abstract: The problem of learning the solution space of an unknown formula has been
  studied in multiple embodiments in computational learning theory. In this article,
  we study a family of such learning problems; this family contains, for each relational
  structure, the problem of learning the solution space of an unknown conjunctive
  query evaluated on the structure. A progression of results aimed to classify the
  learnability of each of the problems in this family, and thus far a culmination
  thereof was a positive learnability result generalizing all previous ones. This
  article completes the classification program towards which this progression of results
  strived, by presenting a negative learnability result that complements the mentioned
  positive learnability result. In order to obtain our negative result, we make use
  of universal-algebraic concepts, and our result is phrased in terms of the varietal
  property of non-congruence modularity.

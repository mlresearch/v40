title: Contextual Dueling Bandits
abstract: We consider the problem of learning to choose actions using contextual information
  when provided with limited feedback in the form of relative pairwise comparisons.
  We study this problem in the dueling-bandits framework of Yue et al. (COLT’09),
  which we extend to incorporate context. Roughly, the learner’s goal is to find the
  best policy, or way of behaving, in some space of policies, although “best” is not
  always so clearly defined. Here, we propose a new and natural solution concept,
  rooted in game theory, called a \emphvon Neumann winner, a randomized policy that
  beats or ties every other policy. We show that this notion overcomes important limitations
  of existing solutions, particularly the Condorcet winner which has typically been
  used in the past, but which requires strong and often unrealistic assumptions. We
  then present three \emphefficient algorithms for online learning in our setting,
  and for approximating a von Neumann winner from batch-like data. The first of these
  algorithms achieves particularly low regret, even when data is adversarial, although
  its time and space requirements are linear in the size of the policy space. The
  other two algorithms require time and space only logarithmic in the size of the
  policy space when provided access to an oracle for solving classification problems
  on the space.

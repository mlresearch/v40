title: 'S2: An Efficient Graph Based Active Learning Algorithm with Application to
  Nonparametric Classification'
abstract: This paper investigates the problem of active learning for binary label
  prediction on a graph. We introduce a simple and label-efficient algorithm called
  S^2 for this task. At each step, S^2 selects the vertex to be labeled based on the
  structure of the graph and all previously gathered labels. Specifically, S^2 queries
  for the label of the vertex that bisects the \em shortest shortest path between
  any pair of oppositely labeled vertices. We present a theoretical estimate of the
  number of queries S^2 needs in terms of a novel  parametrization of the complexity
  of binary functions on graphs. We also present experimental results demonstrating
  the performance of S^2 on both real and synthetic data. While other graph-based
  active learning algorithms have shown promise in practice, our algorithm is the
  first with both good performance and theoretical guarantees. Finally, we demonstrate
  the implications of the S^2 algorithm to the theory of nonparametric active learning.
  In particular, we show that S^2 achieves near minimax optimal excess risk for an
  important class of nonparametric classification problems.

title: Efficient Learning of Linear Separators under Bounded Noise
abstract: 'We study the learnability of linear separators in \Re^d in the presence
  of bounded  (a.k.a Massart) noise. This is a  realistic generalization of the random
  classification noise model, where the adversary can flip each example x with probability
  η(x) ≤η. We provide the first polynomial time algorithm that can learn linear separators
  to arbitrarily small excess error in this noise model under the uniform distribution
  over the unit sphere in \Re^d, for some constant value of η. While widely studied
  in the statistical learning theory community in the context of getting faster convergence
  rates, computationally efficient algorithms in this model had remained elusive.
  Our work provides the first evidence that one can indeed design  algorithms achieving
  arbitrarily small excess error in  polynomial time  under this realistic noise model
  and thus opens up a new and exciting line of research. We additionally provide lower
  bounds showing that popular algorithms such as hinge loss minimization and averaging
  cannot lead to arbitrarily small excess error under Massart noise, even under the
  uniform distribution. Our work, instead, makes use of a margin based technique developed
  in the context of active learning. As a result, our algorithm is also an active
  learning algorithm with label complexity that is only logarithmic in the desired
  excess error ε. '

title: On-Line Learning Algorithms for Path Experts with Non-Additive Losses
abstract: 'We consider two broad families of non-additive loss functions covering
  a large number of applications: rational losses and tropical losses. We give new
  algorithms extending the Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader (FPL) algorithm to both of
  these families of loss functions and similarly give new algorithms extending the
  Randomized Weighted Majority (RWM) algorithm to both of these families. We prove
  that the time complexity of our extensions to rational losses of both FPL and RWM
  is polynomial and present regret bounds for both.  We further show that these algorithms
  can play a critical role in improving performance in applications such as structured
  prediction. '

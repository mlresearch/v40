title: 'Open Problem: Restricted Eigenvalue Condition for Heavy Tailed Designs'
abstract: 'The restricted eigenvalue (RE) condition characterizes the sample complexity
  of accurate recovery in the context of high-dimensional estimators such as Lasso
  and Dantzig selector (Bickel et al., 2009). Recent work has shown that random design
  matrices drawn from any thin-tailed (sub-Gaussian) distributions satisfy the RE
  condition with high probability, when the number of samples scale as the square
  of the Gaussian width of the restricted set (Banerjee et al., 2014; Tropp, 2015).
  We pose the equivalent question for heavy-tailed distributions: Given a random design
  matrix drawn from a heavy-tailed distribution satisfying the smallball property
  (Mendelson, 2015), does the design matrix satisfy the RE condition with the same
  order of sample complexity as sub-Gaussian distributions? An answer to the question
  will guide the design of highdimensional estimators for heavy tailed problems.'

title: Tensor principal component analysis via sum-of-square proofs
abstract: 'We study a statistical model for the \emphtensor principal component analysis
  problem introduced by Montanari and Richard: Given a order-3 tensor \mathbf T of
  the form \mathbf T = τ⋅v_0^⊗3 + \mathbf A, where τ≥0 is a signal-to-noise ratio,
  v_0 is a unit vector, and \mathbf A is a random noise tensor, the goal is to recover
  the planted vector v_0. For the case that \mathbf A has iid standard Gaussian entries,
  we give an efficient algorithm to recover v_0 whenever τ≥ω(n^3/4 \log(n)^1/4), and
  certify that the recovered vector is close to a maximum likelihood estimator, all
  with high probability over the random choice of \mathbf A. The previous best algorithms
  with provable guarantees required τ≥Ω(n). In the regime τ≤o(n), natural tensor-unfolding-based
  spectral relaxations for the underlying optimization problem break down. To go beyond
  this barrier, we use convex relaxations based on the sum-of-squares method. Our
  recovery algorithm proceeds by rounding a degree-4 sum-of-squares relaxations of
  the maximum-likelihood-estimation problem for the statistical model. To complement
  our algorithmic results, we show that degree-4 sum-of-squares relaxations break
  down for τ≤O(n^3/4/\log(n)^1/4), which demonstrates that improving our current guarantees
  (by more than logarithmic factors) would require new techniques or might even be
  intractable. Finally, we show how to exploit additional problem structure in order
  to solve our sum-of-squares relaxations, up to some approximation, very efficiently.
  Our fastest algorithm runs in nearly-linear time using shifted (matrix) power iteration
  and has similar guarantees as above. The analysis of this algorithm also confirms
  a variant of a conjecture of Montanari and Richard about singular vectors of tensor
  unfoldings.'

	<h2>Abstract</h2>
	<div id="abstract">
		The best currently known general lower and upper bounds on the number of labeled examples needed for learning a concept class in the PAC framework (the realizable case) do not perfectly match: they leave a gap of order <span class="math">\(\log(1/\epsilon)\)</span> (resp. a gap which is logarithmic in another one of the relevant parameters). It is an unresolved question whether there exists an “optimal PAC algorithm” which establishes a general upper bound with precisely the same order of magnitude as the general lower bound. According to a result of Auer and Ortner, there is no way for showing that arbitrary consistent algorithms are optimal because they can provably differ from optimality by factor <span class="math">\(\log(1/\epsilon)\)</span>. In contrast to this result, we show that every consistent algorithm <span class="math">\(L\)</span> (even a provably suboptimal one) induces a family <span class="math">\((L_K)_{K\ge1}\)</span> of PAC algorithms (with <span class="math">\(2K-1\)</span> calls of <span class="math">\(L\)</span> as a subroutine) which come very close to optimality: the number of labeled examples needed by <span class="math">\(L_K\)</span> exceeds the general lower bound only by factor <span class="math">\(\ell_K(1/\epsillon)\)</span> where <span class="math">\(\ell_K\)</span> denotes (a truncated version of) the <span class="math">\(K\)</span>-times iterated logarithm. Moreover, <span class="math">\(L_K\)</span> is applicable to any concept class <span class="math">\(C\)</span> of finite VC-dimension and it can be implemented efficiently whenever the consistency problem for <span class="math">\(C\)</span> is feasible. We show furthermore that, for every consistent algorithm <span class="math">\(L\)</span>, <span class="math">\(L_2\)</span> is an optimal PAC algorithm for precisely the same concept classes which were used by Auer and Ortner for showing the existence of suboptimal consistent algorithms. This can be seen as an indication that <span class="math">\(L_K\)</span> may have an even better performance than it is suggested by our worstcase analysis.

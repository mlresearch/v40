title: 'Bandit Convex Optimization: $\sqrt{T}$ Regret in One Dimension'
abstract: 'We analyze the minimax regret of the adversarial bandit convex optimization
  problem.  Focusing on the one-dimensional case, we prove that the minimax regret
  is \widetildeΘ(\sqrtT) and partially resolve a decade-old open problem. Our analysis
  is non-constructive, as we do not present a concrete algorithm that attains this
  regret rate. Instead, we use minimax duality to reduce the problem to a Bayesian
  setting, where the convex loss functions are drawn from a worst-case distribution,
  and then we solve the Bayesian version of the problem with a variant of Thompson
  Sampling. Our analysis features a novel use of convexity, formalized as a “local-to-global”
  property of convex functions, that may be of independent interest. '

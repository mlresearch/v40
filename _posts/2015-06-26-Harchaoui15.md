title: Adaptive Recovery of Signals by Convex Optimization
abstract: 'We present a theoretical framework for adaptive estimation and prediction
  of signals of unknown structure in the presence of noise. The framework allows to
  address two intertwined challenges: (i) designing optimal statistical estimators;
  (ii) designing efficient numerical algorithms. In particular, we establish oracle
  inequalities for the performance of adaptive procedures, which rely upon convex
  optimization and thus can be efficiently implemented. As an application of the proposed
  approach, we consider denoising of harmonic oscillations.'

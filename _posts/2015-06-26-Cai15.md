title: Optimum Statistical Estimation with Strategic Data Sources
abstract: We propose an optimum mechanism for providing monetary incentives to the
  data sources of a statistical estimator such as linear regression, so that high
  quality data is provided at low cost, in the sense that the weighted sum of payments
  and estimation error is minimized.  The mechanism applies to a broad range of estimators,
  including linear and polynomial regression, kernel regression, and, under some additional
  assumptions, ridge regression. It also generalizes to several objectives, including
  minimizing estimation error subject to budget constraints. Besides our concrete
  results for regression problems, we contribute a mechanism design framework through
  which to design and analyze statistical estimators whose examples are supplied by
  workers with cost for labeling said examples.

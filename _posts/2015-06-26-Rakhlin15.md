title: Hierarchies of Relaxations for Online Prediction Problems with Evolving Constraints
abstract: We study online prediction where regret of the algorithm is measured against
  a benchmark defined via evolving constraints. This framework captures online prediction
  on graphs, as well as other prediction problems with combinatorial structure. A
  key aspect here is that finding the optimal benchmark predictor (even in hindsight,
  given all the data) might be computationally hard due to the combinatorial nature
  of the constraints. Despite this, we provide polynomial-time prediction algorithms
  that achieve low regret against combinatorial benchmark sets. We do so by building
  improper learning algorithms based on two ideas that work together. The first is
  to alleviate part of the computational burden through random playout, and the second
  is to employ Lasserre semidefinite hierarchies to approximate the resulting integer
  program. Interestingly, for our prediction algorithms, we only need to compute the
  values of the semidefinite programs and not the rounded solutions. However, the
  integrality gap for Lasserre hierarchy does enter the generic regret bound in terms
  of Rademacher complexity of the benchmark set. This establishes a trade-off between
  the computation time and the regret bound of the algorithm.

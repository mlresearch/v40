title: Computational Lower Bounds for Community Detection on Random Graphs
abstract: 'This paper studies the problem of detecting the presence of a small dense
  community planted in a large Erdős-Rényi random graph \calG(N,q), where the edge
  probability within the community exceeds q by a constant factor. Assuming the hardness
  of the planted clique detection problem, we show that the  computational  complexity
  of detecting the community exhibits the following phase transition phenomenon: As
  the graph size N grows and the graph becomes sparser according to q=N^-α, there
  exists a critical value of α= \frac23, below which there exists a computationally
  intensive procedure that can detect far smaller communities than any computationally
  efficient procedure, and above which a linear-time procedure is statistically optimal.
  The results also lead to the average-case hardness results for recovering the dense
  community and approximating the densest K-subgraph. '

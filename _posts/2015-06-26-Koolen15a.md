title: Second-order Quantile Methods for Experts and Combinatorial Games
abstract: We aim to design strategies for sequential decision making that adjust to
  the difficulty of the learning problem. We study this question both in the setting
  of prediction with expert advice, and for more general combinatorial decision tasks.
  We are not satisfied with just guaranteeing minimax regret rates, but we want our
  algorithms to perform significantly better on easy data. Two popular ways to formalize
  such adaptivity are second-order regret bounds and quantile bounds. The underlying
  notions of ‘easy data’, which may be paraphrased as “the learning problem has small
  variance” and “multiple decisions are useful”, are synergetic. But even though there
  are sophisticated algorithms that exploit one of the two, no existing algorithm
  is able to adapt to both. The difficulty in combining the two notions lies in tuning
  a parameter called the learning rate, whose optimal value behaves non-monotonically.  We
  introduce a potential function for which (very surprisingly!) it is sufficient to
  simply put a prior on learning rates; an approach that does not work for any previous
  method. By choosing the right prior we construct efficient algorithms and show that
  they reap both benefits by proving the first bounds that are both second-order and
  incorporate quantiles.

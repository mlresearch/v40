title: Minimax Fixed-Design Linear Regression
abstract: 'We consider a linear regression game in which the covariates are known
  in advance: at each round, the learner predicts a real-value, the adversary reveals
  a label, and the learner incurs a squared error loss. The aim is to minimize the
  regret with respect to linear predictions.  For a variety of constraints on the
  adversaryâ€™s labels, we show that the minimax optimal strategy is linear, with a
  parameter choice that is reminiscent of ordinary least squares (and as easy to compute).  The
  predictions depend on all covariates, past and future, with a particular weighting
  assigned to future covariates corresponding to the role that they play in the minimax
  regret.  We study two families of label sequences: box constraints (under a covariate
  compatibility condition), and a weighted 2-norm constraint that emerges naturally
  from the analysis.  The strategy is adaptive in the sense that it requires no knowledge
  of the constraint set.  We obtain an explicit expression for the minimax regret
  for these games.  For the case of uniform box constraints, we show that, with worst
  case covariate sequences, the regret is O(d\log T), with no dependence on the scaling
  of the covariates. '

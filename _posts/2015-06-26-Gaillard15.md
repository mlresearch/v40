title: A Chaining Algorithm for Online Nonparametric Regression
abstract: We consider the problem of online nonparametric regression with arbitrary
  deterministic sequences. Using ideas from the chaining technique, we design an algorithm
  that achieves a Dudley-type regret bound similar to the one obtained in a non-constructive
  fashion by Rakhlin and Sridharan (2014). Our regret bound is expressed in terms
  of the metric entropy in the sup norm, which yields optimal guarantees when the
  metric and sequential entropies are of the same order of magnitude. In particular
  our algorithm is the first one that achieves optimal rates for online regression
  over Hölder balls. In addition we show for this example how to adapt our chaining
  algorithm to get a reasonable computational efficiency with similar regret guarantees
  (up to a log factor).

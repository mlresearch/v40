title: 'Beyond Hartigan Consistency: Merge Distortion Metric for Hierarchical Clustering'
abstract: Hierarchical clustering is a popular method for analyzing data which associates
  a tree to a dataset. Hartigan consistency has been used extensively as a framework
  to analyze such clustering algorithms from a statistical point of view. Still, as
  we show in the paper, a tree which is Hartigan consistent with a given density can
  look very different than the correct limit tree. Specifically, Hartigan consistency
  permits two types of undesirable configurations which we term \emphover-segmentation
  and \emphimproper nesting.  Moreover, Hartigan consistency is a limit property and
  does not directly quantify difference between trees. In this paper we identify two
  limit properties, \emphseparation and \emphminimality, which address both over-segmentation
  and improper nesting and together imply (but are not implied by) Hartigan consistency.
  We proceed to introduce a \emphmerge distortion metric between hierarchical clusterings
  and show that convergence in our distance implies both separation and minimality.
  We also prove that uniform separation and minimality imply convergence in the merge
  distortion metric.  Furthermore, we show that our merge distortion metric is stable
  under perturbations of the density. Finally, we demonstrate applicability of these
  concepts by proving convergence results for two clustering algorithms. First, we
  show convergence (and hence separation and minimality) of the recent robust single
  linkage algorithm of Chaudhuri and Dasgupta (2010). Second, we provide convergence
  results on manifolds for  topological  split tree clustering.

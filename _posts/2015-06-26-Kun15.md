title: 'Open Problem: Learning Quantum Circuits with Queries'
abstract: We pose an open problem on the complexity of learning the behavior of a
  quantum circuit with value injection queries. We define the learning model for quantum
  circuits and give preliminary results. Using the test-path lemma of Angluin et al.
  (2009a), we show that new ideas are likely needed to tackle value injection queries
  for the quantum setting.

title: 'Online Learning with Feedback Graphs: Beyond Bandits'
abstract: 'We study a general class of online learning problems where the feedback
  is specified by a graph. This class includes online prediction with expert advice
  and the multi-armed bandit problem, but also several learning problems where the
  online player does not necessarily observe his own loss. We analyze how the structure
  of the feedback graph controls the inherent difficulty of the induced T-round learning
  problem. Specifically, we show that any feedback graph belongs to one of three classes:
  \emphstrongly observable graphs, \emphweakly observable graphs, and \emphunobservable
  graphs. We prove that the first class induces learning problems with \widetildeΘ(α^1/2
  T^1/2) minimax regret, where αis the independence number of the underlying graph;
  the second class induces problems with \widetildeΘ(δ^1/3T^2/3) minimax regret, where
  δis the domination number of a certain portion of the graph; and the third class
  induces problems with linear minimax regret. Our results subsume much of the previous
  work on learning with feedback graphs and reveal new connections to partial monitoring
  games. We also show how the regret is affected if the graphs are allowed to vary
  with time. '

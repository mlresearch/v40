title: Hierarchical Label Queries with Data-Dependent Partitions
abstract: "Given a joint distribution P_X, Y over a space \\Xcal and a label set \\Ycal=\\braces0,
  1, we consider the problem of recovering the labels of an unlabeled sample with
  as few label queries as possible. The recovered \t\t     labels can be passed to
  a passive learner, thus turning the procedure into an active learning approach.
  We analyze a family of labeling procedures based on a hierarchical clustering of
  the data. While such labeling procedures have been studied in the past, we provide
  a new parametrization of P_X, Y that captures their behavior in general low-noise
  settings, and which accounts for data-dependent clustering, thus providing new theoretical
  underpinning to practically used tools. "

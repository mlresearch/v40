title: Fast Mixing for Discrete Point Processes
abstract: We investigate the systematic mechanism for designing fast mixing Markov
  chain Monte Carlo algorithms to sample from discrete point processes under the Dobrushin
  uniqueness condition for Gibbs measures. Discrete point processes are defined as
  probability distributions μ(S)∝\exp(βf(S)) over all subsets S∈2^V of a finite set
  V through a bounded set function f:2^V→\mathbbR and a parameter β>0. A subclass
  of discrete point processes characterized by submodular functions (which include
  log-submodular distributions, submodular point processes, and determinantal point
  processes) has recently gained a lot of interest in machine learning and shown to
  be effective for modeling diversity and coverage. We show that if the set function
  (not necessarily submodular) displays a natural notion of decay of correlation,
  then, for βsmall enough, it is possible to design fast mixing Markov chain Monte
  Carlo methods that yield error bounds on marginal approximations that do not depend
  on the size of the set V. The sufficient conditions that we derive involve a control
  on the (discrete) Hessian of set functions, a quantity that has not been previously
  considered in the literature. We specialize our results for submodular functions,
  and we discuss canonical examples where the Hessian can be easily controlled.

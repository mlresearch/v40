title: Truthful Linear Regression
abstract: We consider the problem of fitting a linear model to data held by individuals
  who are concerned about their privacy. Incentivizing most players to truthfully
  report their data to the analyst constrains our design to mechanisms that provide
  a privacy guarantee to the participants; we use differential privacy to model individualsâ€™
  privacy losses. This immediately poses a problem, as differentially private computation
  of a linear model necessarily produces a biased estimation, and existing approaches
  to design mechanisms to elicit data from privacy-sensitive individuals do not generalize
  well to biased estimators. We overcome this challenge through an appropriate design
  of the computation and payment scheme.

title: Interactive Fingerprinting Codes and the Hardness of Preventing False Discovery
abstract: We show an essentially tight bound on the number of adaptively chosen statistical
  queries that a computationally efficient algorithm can answer accurately given n
  samples from an unknown distribution.  A statistical query asks for the expectation
  of a predicate over the underlying distribution, and an answer to a statistical
  query is accurate if it is “close” to the correct expectation over the distribution.  This
  question was recently studied by Dwork et al. (2015), who showed how to answer \tildeΩ(n^2)
  queries efficiently, and also by Hardt and Ulman (2014), who showed that answering
  \tildeO(n^3) queries is hard.  We close the gap between the two bounds and show
  that, under a standard hardness assumption, there is no computationally efficient
  algorithm that, given n samples from an unknown distribution, can give valid answers
  to O(n^2) adaptively chosen statistical queries.  An implication of our results
  is that computationally efficient algorithms for answering arbitrary, adaptively
  chosen statistical queries may as well be \emphdifferentially private. We obtain
  our results using a new connection between the problem of answering adaptively chosen
  statistical queries and a combinatorial object called an \emphinteractive fingerprinting
  code Fiat and Tassa (2001).  In order to optimize our hardness result, we give a
  new Fourier-analytic approach to analyzing fingerprinting codes that is simpler,
  more flexible, and yields better parameters than previous constructions.

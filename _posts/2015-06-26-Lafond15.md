title: Low Rank Matrix Completion with Exponential Family Noise
abstract: The matrix completion problem consists in reconstructing a matrix from a
  sample of entries, possibly observed with noise. A popular class of estimator, known
  as nuclear norm penalized estimators, are based on minimizing the sum of a data
  fitting term and a nuclear norm penalization. Here, we investigate the case where
  the noise distribution belongs to the exponential family and is sub-exponential.
  Our framework allows for a general sampling scheme. We first consider an estimator
  defined as the minimizer of the sum of a log-likelihood term and a nuclear norm
  penalization and prove an upper bound on the Frobenius prediction risk. The rate
  obtained improves on previous works on matrix completion for exponential family.
  When the sampling distribution is known, we propose another estimator and prove
  an oracle inequality \em w.r.t. the Kullback-Leibler prediction risk, which translates
  immediately into an upper bound on the Frobenius prediction risk. Finally, we show
  that all the rates obtained are minimax optimal up to a logarithmic factor.

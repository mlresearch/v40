title: Correlation Clustering with Noisy Partial Information
abstract: In this paper, we propose and study a semi-random model for the Correlation
  Clustering problem on arbitrary graphs G. We give two approximation algorithms for
  Correlation Clustering instances from this model. The first algorithm finds a solution
  of value (1+ δ)\mathrmopt-cost + O_δ(n\log^3 n) with high probability, where \mathrmopt-cost
  is the value of the optimal solution (for every δ> 0). The second algorithm finds
  the ground truth clustering with an arbitrarily small classification error η(under
  some additional assumptions on the instance).

title: 'Escaping the Local Minima via Simulated Annealing: Optimization of Approximately
  Convex Functions'
abstract: We consider the problem of optimizing an approximately convex function over
  a bounded convex set in \mathbbR^n  using only function evaluations. The problem
  is reduced to sampling from an \emphapproximately log-concave distribution using
  the Hit-and-Run method, which is shown to have the same \mathcalO^* complexity as
  sampling from log-concave distributions. In addition to extend the analysis for
  log-concave distributions to approximate log-concave distributions, the implementation
  of the 1-dimensional sampler of the Hit-and-Run walk requires new methods and analysis.
  The algorithm then is based on simulated annealing which does not relies on first
  order conditions which makes it essentially immune to local minima. We then apply
  the method to different motivating problems. In the context of zeroth order stochastic
  convex optimization, the proposed method produces an ε-minimizer after \mathcalO^*(n^7.5ε^-2)
  noisy function evaluations  by inducing a \mathcalO(ε/n)-approximately log concave
  distribution. We also consider in detail the case when the “amount of non-convexity”
  decays towards the optimum of the function. Other applications of the method discussed
  in this work include private computation of empirical risk minimizers, two-stage
  stochastic programming, and approximate dynamic programming for online learning.
